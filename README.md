# YOLOv10 Projects for Object Detection

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook solutions utilizing the YOLOv10 model:
1. **YOLOv10 Pre-trained Inference** - Using the pre-trained YOLOv10 model for object detection.
2. **YOLOv10 Helmet Safety Fine-tuning** - Fine-tuning the YOLOv10 model specifically for helmet detection to enhance safety measures.

## Project Overview

### 1. YOLOv10 Pre-trained Inference
This project utilizes the pre-trained YOLOv10 model to detect objects in images without requiring further model adjustments. This solution demonstrates how to load YOLOv10 and perform inference for general object detection tasks.

### 2. YOLOv10 Helmet Safety Fine-tuning
This solution fine-tunes the YOLOv10 model to detect helmets in images. Fine-tuning YOLOv10 for this specific use case enables improved safety detection in environments where helmet usage is critical, such as construction sites or industrial zones.
