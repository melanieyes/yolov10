Project Overview
1. YOLOv10 Pre-trained Inference
This project utilizes the pre-trained YOLOv10 model to detect objects in images without requiring further model adjustments. This solution demonstrates how to load YOLOv10 and perform inference for general object detection tasks.

2. YOLOv10 Helmet Safety Fine-tuning
This solution fine-tunes the YOLOv10 model to detect helmets in images. Fine-tuning YOLOv10 for this specific use case enables improved safety detection in environments where helmet usage is critical, such as construction sites or industrial zones.

Requirements
Both projects rely on similar dependencies. Ensure you have the following packages installed:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
YOLOv10 (follow the YOLOv10 installation instructions)
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Any additional libraries as specified in each notebook.
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Customize requirements.txt according to the specific libraries used in the projects.

Usage
1. YOLOv10 Pre-trained Inference
Load Notebook: Open [Solution]_YOLOv10_Pre-trained_Inference.ipynb.
Run the Cells: Follow the steps in the notebook to load the model and run inference on sample images.
Modify for Custom Images: Replace sample images with your own images by updating the image paths.
2. YOLOv10 Helmet Safety Fine-tuning
Load Notebook: Open [Solution]_YOLOv10_Helmet_Safety_Finetuning.ipynb.
Data Preparation: Prepare a dataset with images labeled for helmet detection.
Run Fine-tuning: Execute cells to train the model on the custom dataset.
Evaluate: Review model performance and adjust parameters if necessary.
Results
YOLOv10 Pre-trained Inference
The model provides bounding boxes and class labels for general objects within images, demonstrating its out-of-the-box detection capabilities.

YOLOv10 Helmet Safety Fine-tuning
After fine-tuning, the model improves detection accuracy for helmets, specifically, showing higher precision and recall for helmet-related object detection.
